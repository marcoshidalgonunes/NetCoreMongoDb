# Service

This project is adapted from [Create a web API with ASP.NET Core and MongoDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mongo-app?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio) to use [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) process.

It uses [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-aspnetcore) for logging, following the example from [ASP.NET Core 5 + Serilog](https://jkdev.me/asp-net-core-serilog/).
